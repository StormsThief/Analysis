## Project Description
The healthcare prediction dataset contains various columns related to patient care, including admission and discharge dates, patient demographics, and other relevant medical information. The analysis involves calculating hospital stay durations and identifying any missing values in the dataset.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization (if applicable).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Environment for interactive coding and visualization.
## Data Description 
- **Admission Date**: The date when the patient was admitted to the hospital.
- **Discharge Date**: The date when the patient was discharged from the hospital.
- **Patient Name**: The name of the patient (considered for removal in analysis).
- **Room Assigned**: The room number assigned to the patient (considered for removal in analysis).
- **Attending Doctor**: The name of the doctor attending to the patient (considered for removal in analysis).
- **Hospital Stay Duration**: Calculated duration of the hospital stay in days.
## Installation
## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/StormsThief/healthcare-prediction.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd healthcare-prediction
3. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn


## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis:
```bash
   jupyter notebook




## Analysis Steps
1. Load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Check for missing values in the dataset.
3. Convert admission and discharge dates to datetime format.
4. Calculate hospital stay duration.
5. Drop unnecessary columns.
6. Analyze and visualize the data (optional).
## Results
The analysis provides insights into:

    The average duration of hospital stays.
    Trends in patient admissions and discharges.
    Any potential correlations between demographics and hospital stay duration.
